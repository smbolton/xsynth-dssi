Needs to be done
================

- implement osc_configure_handler() 'load'

- clean up all '!FIX!'es

- complete documention

? GUI: add patch import (just set values, select Patch Edit tab)

! interaction between MIDI volume controller and volume saved in
    patch on program change is not pleasant

Wish list
=========

? GUI: should Patch Edit Save Changes select the program number of
    the saved-to patch?

- render: fix resonance limiting so it doesn't blork at zero with
    high cutoffs

- render: move envelope conditionals outside inner loop; implement
    ramping of modulators (pitch bend, mod wheel, pressure, ...)

- all: make modwheel->cutoff and pressure->resonance modulations
    configurable
