                                 ===========
                    A software synthesizer plugin for the
                          DSSI Soft Synth Interface

Xsynth-DSSI is written and maintained by Sean Bolton.  It is

directly to Sean at the email address:

Much of the sound generation code and bits of the user interface
code comes from Xsynth v1.0.2, copyright (c) 1999 S. J. Brookes,
under the GNU General Public License version 2.

Portions of the minBLEP oscillator code are based on Fons
Adriaensen's VCO-plugins v0.3.0, copyright (c) 2003 under the GNU
General Public License version 2.  (Thanks also to Daniel Werner for
his public domain minBLEP generation code, upon which I based my
discontinuity-delta generation code).

The MVCLPF-3 filter was taken directly from Fons Adriaensen's
MCP-plugins v0.3.0, copyright (c) 2003 under the GNU General Public
License version 2.

Major portions of the event handling code are derived from
Fluidsynth, copyright (c) 2003 Peter Hanappe and others, under the
GNU General Public License version 2.

Portions of the DSSI interface and OSC handling code come from Chris
Cannam and Steve Harris's public domain DSSI example code.
